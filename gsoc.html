                    <p>After completing my GSoC-2015 project with <a href="http://ceph.com">Ceph</a> and enjoying 3 months of fun learning. I am writing this blog to give some suggestions regarding improving your chances of getting accepted into GSoC and <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Opportunities">similar programs</a>. I will also include a glimpse of what’s ahead and address most of the frequently asked questions about Google Summer of Code.</p><br>
                    <p>My suggestions:
                        <ul>
                        <li>Start early.</li>
                        <li> Choose an organization and project.</li>
                        <li>Read documentation.</li>
                        <li> Involve in the community.</li>
                        <li> Submit your proposal early.</li>
                        <li> Be kind and confident.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>Now let me simplify above mentioned:
                        <ol>
                        <li>Start Early.<br>I believe one can do anything, if given ample time. So, if you consider yourself not so good at technical front, try to compensate it with investing more time and labor than others. Here, you are not expected to be the world’s best programmer. On the contrary, this is to teach you about new stuff. At this time it will be sensible to get familiar with git and GitHub, if not already.</li><br>
                        <li>Choose an organization and project.<br>Its an important task, usually underrated. Start by looking at list of accepted organizations at program homepage (<a href="http://www.google-melange.com">google-melange</a> in case of GSoC). If the list is not up yet(good for you, you have more time) try looking at previous years' short-listed organizations, list won’t change much. Examine organizations and their project ideas(these will be available after a organization is selected into program). Select single or multiple organizations and project(s). You can also try for more than one project in single organization. Select one(s) you feel that you understand or seems interesting and fun to you. Be sure to get in touch with mentor(s) to show your interest and to gain insights.<br>Why is this important? Because you will work on the project for 3 months and you want this time to be exciting and fun rather than dull and boring. Find yourself a project that you can keep your focus on, being amused by it.</li><br>
                        <li>Read documentation.<br>Try to understand what the organization is actually doing. Read published papers, documentation, etc. to get a full bright picture. You can also try to familiarize yourself with the source code associated with your chosen project available at GitHub.</li><br>
                        <li>Involve in the community.<br>Most of the organizations have a "How to Contribute" page on their website. Its a good place to start. If you are unable to find it, start by joining developers #channel on IRC and by subscribing to mailing list of the organizations you want to propose. Interact with fellow developers. You should also try to get your hands dirty on easy bugs. Just look around in bug tracker these are usually tagged as low hanging fruits, intentionally left for newcomers.  Submitting patch for a bug or two will increase your odds greatly.  Tackling your problems on your own is more fruitful. But, you can always ask developers on IRC or email mentor about the problem. Never hesitate to ask, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_stupid_question">there is no such thing as a stupid question</a>. Sometimes it can be difficult for developers to answer your query straight away. Don’t worry just put it on their IRC channel, I’m sure someone will get to you.</li><br>
                        <li>Submit your proposal early.<br>Understand the problem carefully and write solution according to the present situation of organization’s code and setup. Always ask project mentor to elaborate what he/she wants to achieve. Once objective starts looking clear to you, you can start writing your proposal. Your proposal should provide clear solutions and it can be enhanced by including example code snippets. Try to submit it early once submission window is open. But, never submit your proposal unfinished. Nobody likes undercooked food.You should get guidelines from organization on how to structure your proposal. If nothing is specified you can follow this general structure:
                        <ol><li>About yourself</li>
                        <li>Project Summary</li>
                        <li>Your Plans</li>
                        <li>Detailed Timeline</li>
                        <li>Maintenance</li>
                        <li>Why this organization and project?</li>
                        <li>Why you?</li></ol>
                        Cover these sections efficiently, your proposal should do good. After submission, you can always ask mentor to give feedback. Then, you can edit your proposal until the deadline. This is why, I recommend you to submit proposal early. Thereafter project mentors and organization leads will rate your proposal and will decide your fate comparing with all other proposals they receive.</li><br>
                        <li>Be kind and confident.<br>You should always have faith in yourself even if you think you don’t know enough about computer stuff. Forget all your fears. Ask all your stupid questions. Embarrass yourself. Put all your efforts. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuHfVn_cfHU">Just do it</a>.<br>Be generous. Extend your hand to help anyone in the community or out of it, whenever they need. Always thank people whenever they help you. It never takes much to thank someone. Never miss on these small things. I am sure at the end you will feel great.<br></li>
                        May the odds favor you. Good luck!  It's a great experience and definitely a goal worth working towards.<br><br><em>You can also read My Journey(will write soon and put link here) to know my secret and to know how easy it actually is.<br>Please feel free to ask me any question or leave any suggestion related to the topic or just say hi! to me(mail icon on the left side). I will be more than happy to help :)</em>
